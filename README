# cache-simulator
implementation of a cache along with a matrix transpose program.

This implementation is based off the cache lab in the computer systems: A programmers prespective.you implementa a cache simulator and a cache efficient matrix transpose program.

************************
Running the autograders:
************************

Before running the autograders, compile your code:

    linux> make

Check the correctness of your simulator:

    linux> ./test-csim

Check the correctness and performance of your transpose functions:

    linux> ./test-trans -M 32 -N 32
    
    linux> ./test-trans -M 64 -N 64
    
    linux> ./test-trans -M 61 -N 67

Check everything at once (this is the program that your instructor runs):

    linux> ./driver.py
